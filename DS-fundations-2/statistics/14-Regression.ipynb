    "A common way to visualize these relationships is with a scatter plot. The variable on the $Y$ axis is called *the response* or *dependent*, where the variable on the $X$ axis is called *explanatory* or *independent*\n",

    "The **scatter plot** can be used to visualize both the strength and the direction of the relationship between two variables.\n",
    "* Positive relation: when both variables increases.\n",
    "* Negative relation: when one variable increases and the other decreases.\n",
    "* As the points spread out from one another this weakens the relationship.\n",
    "* To identify strong or weak relationships, we aren't so much looking at the slope associated with the relationship.\n",

    "[$Correlation$ $coeficient$ $of$ $Pearson$ $(r)$](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeficiente_de_correla%C3%A7%C3%A3o_de_Pearson) is the strength and direction of a linear relationship, always between -1 and 1, where the closer it is to 1 or -1, the stronger the relationship. Negative values indicate negative relationship, otherwise positive relationship.\n",
